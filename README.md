# module1challenge
Hi my name is Jessep Stynchcomb and this is my repository for Module 1 Challenge. This was a challenge encouraging you to edit the existing code to allow for a better viewing experience for whoever views the Html or Css. On line 7 of html 'website' was changed to Horiseon Homepage to be more descriptive. 'header' replaced div on lines 11 and 26 to be more specific about the section. 'nav' replaced div on lines 13 and 25 because the links in that section are used to navigate the site. 'section' replaced div on lines 31 and 53. 'section' replaced div on lines 56 and 78. All image urls were given an alt description to describe what the images are incase the images don't load. 'id' was added after div on line 32 to allow for the link to function. Alt descriptions were added to the 3 png files in 'section'. 'Footer' replaced on lines 81 and 86. extra space was added in between each section to help the html code look less cluttered. Periods were removed from all 'header' and 'footer' elements in CSS. Quotes were added to 'Calibri' on all font families because they were missing.
